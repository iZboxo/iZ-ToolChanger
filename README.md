# iZ-ToolChanger
DIY tool-changing 3D printer based on Prusa XL & iX.

## At first I want to declare: I'm not building a 3D printer, I'm designing a tool-changer.  
-> I've found the Prusa XL frame best for my needs of testing. I've settled on the iX size of the printer - 270x270x?210? printing space.

# Current state? - Yeah, only bare-bones frame
